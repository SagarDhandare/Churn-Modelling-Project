## Dataset
[Churn Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/c/churn-modelling/)

## Dataset Description
#### What is Churn Rate?
The churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service who discontinue their subscriptions to the service within a given time period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed its churn rate.

## Problem Statement
The Company wants a model which can predict that how likely its current customers will leave the company in near future and hence calculate its churn rate.

This is a Classification Problem in which you'll classify a customer based on his/her Credit Score, Region, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Salary etc. whether he/she will EXIT(1) or NOT(0).

## About the Dataset:
The dataset is well-labeled to explain all its columns. The Target Variable is EXITED(0/1) which you have to predict.
